License: CC-SA-1.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
 encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with
 a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works
 in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
 a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
 for the purposes of this License.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon
 the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
 musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
 sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form
 in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work
 that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
 for the purpose of this License.  "Licensor" means the individual or entity
 that offers the Work under the terms of this License.  "Original Author" means
 the individual or entity who created the Work.  "Work" means the copyrightable
 work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.  "You" means an
 individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
 previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who
 has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
 this License despite a previous violation.  2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in
 this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from
 fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the
 copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
 (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights
 in the Work as stated below:
 .
 to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
 Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; to
 create and reproduce Derivative Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords
 of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
 digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
 Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
 publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
 Derivative Works; The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats
 whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
 make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
 other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
 hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
 copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy
 or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
 or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
 Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
 exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You
 must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
 of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
 publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
 control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of
 this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
 Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
 Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
 Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
 the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
 notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
 Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
 requested.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
 publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
 License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
 for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You
 distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform.
 You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or
 restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
 granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
 License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
 display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work
 with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
 manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
 applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
 does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to
 be made subject to the terms of this License.  5. Representations, Warranties
 and Disclaimer
 .
 By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor
 represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after
 reasonable inquiry: Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to
 grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the
 rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any
 royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments; The Work
 does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law
 rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
 invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.  EXCEPT AS
 EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
 WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.  6. Limitation on
 Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR
 DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE
 WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
 DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
 upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
 who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
 License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
 individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
 Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
 under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
 provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
 License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
 under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
 and effect unless terminated as stated above.  8. Miscellaneous
 .
 Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
 Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on
 the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
 License.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
 Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
 same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
 law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
 the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
 agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
 make such provision valid and enforceable.  No term or provision of this
 License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver
 or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
 waiver or consent.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
 parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
 Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in
 any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
 mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
 extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
 granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
 these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
 consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
 Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
 .
 Section 1 -- Definitions.
 .
  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed

     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,

     Rights.
 .
  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws

     agreements.
 .
  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.
 .
  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.
 .
  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.
 .
  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
  a. License grant.
 .
       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and
 .
            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.
 .
       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).
 .
       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
       5. Downstream recipients.
 .
            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.
 .
            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.
 .
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
  b. Other rights.
 .
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.
 .
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
 .
       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:
 .
            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:
 .
                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);
 .
                ii. a copyright notice;
 .
               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;
 .
                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;
 .
            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
 .
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.
 .
       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;
 .
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.
 .
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or
 .
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.
 .
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.
 .
  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .

License: EPL-1.0
 Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
 LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
 CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
 1. DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Contribution" means:
 .
 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
 distributed under this Agreement, and
 .
 b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
 .
 i) changes to the Program, and
 .
 ii) additions to the Program;
 .
 where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
 distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from
 a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
 anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
 additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
 distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license
 agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
 .
 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
 .
 "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
 necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
 combined with the Program.
 .
 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
 Agreement.
 .
 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
 including all Contributors.
 .
 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
 a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
 reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
 distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
 such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
 .
 b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
 Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
 transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
 object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
 Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
 Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
 covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
 other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
 licensed hereunder.
 .
 c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
 to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
 Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
 intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
 any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
 infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
 exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
 assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
 needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
 allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
 to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
 .
 d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
 copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
 set forth in this Agreement.
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
 its own license agreement, provided that:
 .
 a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 .
 b) its license agreement:
 .
 i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
 conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
 and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
 and fitness for a particular purpose;
 .
 ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
 damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
 damages, such as lost profits;
 .
 iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
 by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
 .
 iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
 Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
 or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 .
 When the Program is made available in source code form:
 .
 a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 .
 b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
 .
 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
 the Program.
 .
 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
 if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
 the originator of the Contribution.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
 respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
 intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
 includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
 manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
 Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
 offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
 and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
 losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
 lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
 Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
 Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
 a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
 to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
 property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
 a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
 b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
 Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
 negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
 at its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
 offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
 that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
 warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
 such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
 Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
 Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
 court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
 Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
 AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
 EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
 CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
 associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but
 not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
 applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
 unavailability or interruption of operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
 CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
 OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
 remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
 parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
 necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
 (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
 infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
 under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
 comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
 does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
 aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
 terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
 soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
 Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
 continue and survive.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
 order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
 modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
 publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
 time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
 Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
 Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
 Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
 be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
 Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
 Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
 the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
 (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
 stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
 licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
 Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
 rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 .
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
 intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
 Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
 after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
 in any resulting litigation.
