# Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth

This project contains a generic implementation of [OAuth2 Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/) for ASP.NET Core. While it can be used directly, it's often easier to use a derived implementation for a specific provider. Adjacent directories contain providers for Facebook, Google, Microsoft Accounts, and Twitter.

Some community projects related to OAuth for ASP.NET Core are listed in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/).
