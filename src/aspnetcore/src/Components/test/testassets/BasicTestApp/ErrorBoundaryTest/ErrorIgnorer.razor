@inherits ErrorBoundaryBase
@*
    A badly-behaved error boundary that tries to keep using its same ChildContent even after an error.
    This is to check we still don't retain the descendant component instances.

@ChildContent

@code {
    protected override Task OnErrorAsync(Exception exception)
    {
        // Ignore it
        return Task.CompletedTask;
